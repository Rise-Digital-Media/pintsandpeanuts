<p>
<font color="teal">INFORMATION AND AVAILABILITY</font>
</p>
<p>
While we take every care to ensure that the information provided by the Services is accurate and complete, some
of it may be supplied to us by third parties and where that is the case we are often unable to check its
accuracy or completeness. You are advised to verify the accuracy of any information before relying on it.
We will do our utmost to ensure that the Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be
error-free. However, due to the nature of the Internet this cannot be guaranteed. Your access to the Services
may also be suspended or restricted occasionally to allow for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new
facilities or services. We will always try to limit the frequency and duration of any disruption.
The Services are provided on an "as is" basis without any warranties of any kind, and to the fullest extent
permitted by law we will not be liable for any inaccuracy or omission in the information provided by the
Services or any interruptions in availability of the Services.

<p>
<font color="teal">CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY YOU</font>
</p>
<p>
The website may from time to time invite you to comment on articles and join in webchats. By contributing you
are granting us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free licence to store your contributions on our
servers and to display the contributions on the Services. We can't promise that we will use all contributions
provided to us.
We want to keep the websites clean and friendly. Please do not submit contributions that are offensive, racist,
harassing, illegal, misleading, abusive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable. We do our best to
monitor and moderate contributions but we cannot monitor them all and you therefore could be at risk yourself if
you contribute anything objectionable. As you might expect we reserve the right to take down any contribution
that breaches any of the above rules, and we may be obliged to pass copies to appropriate authorities. We
reserve the right, among other things, to suspend or terminate your access to the Services if you are in breach
of these Terms, for example by submitting contributions that are unsuitable.

<p>
<font color="teal">COMPETITIONS</font>
</p>
<p>
The competitions that we run through the Services are subject to the following rules (unless otherwise
specified):
No purchase is necessary.
One online entry is permitted per household, and no bulk or third party entries are permitted.
Competitions are open to all UK residents (over the age of 18 in alcohol, tobacco or travel-related
competitions, and in other cases as stated) except our employees, the companies or organisations with whom the
competition or offer is being run, their agents, or anyone directly connected with the promotion.
Proof of entry will not be accepted as proof of receipt of entry.
If we run a competition or offer with a promoter where that promoter is responsible for the provision of the
offer or prizes then ShortList Media will not be responsible for or have any liability for the provision of
those offers or prizes.
We reserve in all cases the right to replace the stated prizes with other prizes that we consider to be of
broadly equivalent value. We offer no cash alternative for non-cash prizes, and prize winners must accept prizes
in the form offered. Prizes are not refundable or transferable.
The winner may be required to sign a statement proving their eligibility/liability.
The closing date for receipt of entries is as stated for each individual competition. The winner(s) will be
drawn at random from all valid entries, and will be notified by email or phone within two weeks of the closing
date.
Detail of the winner(s) can be obtained by sending a SAE marked [name of competition] to ShortList Media Ltd,
26-34 Emerald Street, London WC1N 3QA, United Kingdom within 21 days of the closing date of the promotion.
Details of all entries will be kept on a database and will only be passed to third parties to enable analysis or
the processing of the competition and prize fulfillment unless you specifically allow the data to be shared.
This is the only occasion when another organisation apart from Shortlist Media will have access to your
information. Data will only be shared with the competition partner when you consent to it by ticking the box on
an offer or competition. The sponsor will be clearly named in the text next to the tick box and if the box is
not ticked your data will not be shared. Any use will be in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
All entrants to competitions and offers are deemed to have accepted these rules and agree to be bound by them,
and agree to co-operate in any publicity that may arise which may include their name or image being used on
websites, magazines or mobile services at any time as a result of the competition.
Please remember to get permission from the person who pays the bill before you enter via SMS.
We reserve the right to disqualify or not award a prize to an entrant who in our opinion has not entered in to
the spirit of these terms and conditions or the intention of the competition.
Suppliers cannot be held responsible for the breakdown in communication systems or networks that may result in a
text message not being registered or a text message not being delivered correctly.
