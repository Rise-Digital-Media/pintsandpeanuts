<font color="teal">How do I sign up to receive Emerald Street?</font>
</p>
<p>
You can sign up to receive the Emerald Street daily email service by filling in your email address in the box on
the home page of www.emeraldstreet.com. Very occasionally the box doesn't appear. This is likely to be because
the device you are viewing the website on
does not have JavaScript enabled. This can be a problem if you are using a company email address because of
security settings or if you are using a mobile device which doesn't allow this functionality.
The easiest way round the problem is to send us an email at support@emeraldstreet.com and we will add you to our
mailing list.

<font color="teal">I've signed up but I'm still not receiving Emerald Street</font>
</p>
If you have already registered but don't seem to receiving the email this could be because your email service
provider has classified the email as junk mail. Although we make every effort to ensure that this doesn't
happen
the individual settings of email accounts sometimes mean that emails don't get through to your inbox. In order
to rectify this you should add daily@stylist.emeraldstreet.com to your inbox safe list.
If you are using a work email address then your company mail filters may be the problem. In some companies junk
mail is filtered by the IT department into a central location meaning that it won't appear in your individual
junk mail folders. You can speak nicely to your IT department and ask to have the domain
@stylist.emeraldstreet.com added to your company whitelist or alternatively sign up with a personal email
account.

<p>
There are also a number of email address formats we are unable to broadcast to. Examples of these are info@ and
contact@. These are removed by our system due to the fact that quite often these email addresses are used to
email multiple users across a company and can easily be targeted by spammers.

</p>
<p>
Over time Emerald Street will become increasingly personalised to what you want to read about. By telling us the
things that you are interested in it means that we can send you things specifically tailored to you.

<font color="teal">I live in Leeds but I work in London. Can I receive two versions of the Emerald Street weekend guide?</font>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately in order to receive two regional versions of Emerald Street you will need to sign up with two
email addresses.
</p>
<p>
<font color="teal">How can I unsubscribe from Emerald Street?</font>
</p>
<p>
We really don't want you to unsubscribe but if you feel Emerald Street isn't for you then you can stop
receiving
it by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any email or by logging into emeraldstreet.com and clicking on the
link at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
<font color="teal">I enjoy reading Emerald Street but I don't want to receive it every day. Can I make my subscription less
frequent?</font>
</p>
<p>
When clicking on the unsubscribe link you will see there is also an option to change your frequency. If you
decide you still want to receive Emerald Street but you'd just rather have it less often, then simply choose
which days you would like and click finish.
</p>
<p>
<font color="teal">What are Partnership emails?</font>
</p>
<p>
Partnership emails are messages from carefully selected brands we feel you would be interested in hearing about.
These are companies that have paid to advertise with Emerald Street that we feel provide a product or service is
of interest to our readers.
